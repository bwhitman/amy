## ChatGPT on the audio flow in the index.html

This code sets up a Web Audio API-based audio processing chain that communicates with C++ code compiled with Emscripten.

The setupAudio() function creates an AudioContext object, a ScriptProcessorNode object, and a BufferSource object. The ScriptProcessorNode object is used to provide an audio processing callback function (callback()) that is passed to the setupAudio() function as an argument. The callback() function retrieves data from the BufferSource, processes it using C++ code called through the web_audio_buffer function, and writes the resulting audio samples back to the output buffer.

The C++ code is loaded asynchronously using the import() function and a Promise. Once the C++ code is loaded and ready to use, the onRuntimeInitialized callback function is executed. This function sets up three functions to interface with the C++ code: web_audio_buffer(), amy_play_message(), and amy_start_web().

The startAudio() function initializes the audio processing chain by calling the setupAudio() function and connecting the ScriptProcessorNode object to the audio context's destination. It then starts the BufferSource, which triggers the callback() function to start processing audio. After a 500 millisecond delay, the amy_play_message() function is called with a message string, which is passed to the C++ code for further processing.

The stopAudio() function stops the BufferSource and suspends the AudioContext.

The reset() function sends a message string to the amy_play_message() function to reset the C++ code's internal state.

The three buttons in the HTML document call startAudio(), stopAudio(), and reset() when clicked.
